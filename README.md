  made window unresizable <br/>
# Dependencies
tkinter <br/>

# Instructions for launch
In order to launch the program, download the IDLE python IDE. download and run the GI.py script in this IDE. IDLE automatically comes with python and the dependencies. <br/>

# Instructions for use
When using, the user can either enter scalar numbers or use the \[\] button to create a matrix. The user will then have to enter the matrix width and height and then enter the values in the next window. once you have a scalar number or matrix, press the multiplication, addition, or subtraction button to begin entering the second number/matrix. after that, press = in order to calculate the value. If the value is uncalculatable, it will print the word nope instead. If the user presses c, it will clear all values and allow a clean slate. <br/>

# Why make this
This small matrix calculator is supposed to show my skill in a few areas, the ability to make GUI that is comprehensible, the ability to make secondary libraries that help with an application (matrix.py). and the ability to make a cohesive and well functioning application.
